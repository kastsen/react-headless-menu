# Headless React Menu

A flexible **headless menu component** built with **React**, **TypeScript**, and **Tailwind CSS**.  
Designed to provide only the logic while leaving styling and rendering to the consumer component. Fully component-based (JSX) and mobile-friendly.

---

## Features

- **Headless UI**: only logic, consumer handles styling and presentation.
- Easy to integrate with **external state** (`useState`, `localStorage`, etc.).
- Flexible **React Router integration** without directly coupling routing logic.
- **Mobile-ready**: adapts behavior and layout based on viewport size.
